Then I was asked to present what I learnt and prepare this informal tutorial for my colleagues, which I presented on March 10th, 2020 (yes, early pandemic :confounded:). This post shares the result.\n\nThis is not supposed to be taken as a formal guide to linear mixed-effects models, but rather as a semi-coherent compilation of notes and self-suggestions that I considered worth sharing with my lab mates during my early stages of in the PhD. Here are the [slides](https://gongcastro.github.io/2020-03-31_linear-mixed-models/#1):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n```{=html}\n<div class=\"shareagain\" style=\"min-width:300px;margin:1em auto;\" data-exeternal=\"1\">\n<iframe src=\"https://gongcastro.github.io/2020-03-31_linear-mixed-models/#1\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" style=\"border:2px solid currentColor;\" loading=\"lazy\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n<script>fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});</script>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat I should be taken more seriously are (1) the **references** I suggest in the first slides (which I consider some of the best resources available to learn linear mixed-effects models), and (2) the **memes**, which I personally curated and even created to sweeten up the dreadful incoherence of the content of some of the slides (sorry about that).\n\nBefore the presentation I tweeted one of the animations I generated for it.\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Tomorrow I’ll be talking about multilevel models with some colleagues. I’ve been playing with some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/dataviz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#dataviz</a> for the slides. Not perfect, but I’m quite happy with this.
