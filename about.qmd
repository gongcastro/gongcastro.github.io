I am a cognitive scientist interested in the application of Bayesian modelling in the investigation of early language acquisition and its evolutionary roots. I am currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at the [Institut de Rercerca Sant Joan de DÃ©u](https://www.irsjd.org/en/) (Barcelona, Spain), were I use brain imaging (fNIRS), behavioural, and computational techniques to study how newborns, infants, and non-human animals perceive speech.

I particularly enjoy building code-based workflows, ensuring that my projects can be run by others and my future self, from data collection to visualisation and reporting. I mainly use Twitter ([\@gongcastro](https://twitter.com/gongcastro)) for sharing research outputs, programming tips or data visualisations. You can also follow me on GitHub for some portfolio projects like:

* [{bvq}](https://github.com/gongcastro/bvq): R package for downloading and processing vocabulary data from 10-40 month-old children living in the Metropolitan Area of Barcelona (Spain) [[website](https://gongcastro.github.io/bvq/)]
* [{comidistar}](https://github.com/gongcastro/comidistar): R package containing the scores given to products in the blind taste tests of [El Comidista](https://elcomidista.elpais.com/)
* [psicotuiterbot](https://github.com/gongcastro/psicotuiterbot): A Twitter [bot](https://twitter.com/psicotuiterbot) programmed in R using {rtweet} that automatically retweets mentions of the hasthtags #psicotuiter or #psicotwitter in Spanish
