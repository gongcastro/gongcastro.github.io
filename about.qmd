I am a PhD student at the [Center for Brain and Cognition](https://www.upf.edu/web/cbc), at Universitat Pompeu Fabra (Barcelona, Spain). I study how bilingual toddlers develop their vocabulary, using both experimental and observational techniques. Learning new things about programming languages brings me joy. I mainly use Twitter for sharing research outputs, programming tips or data visualisations. Don't hesitate to get in touch on Twitter ([\@gongcastro](https://twitter.com/gongcastro)) or at [gonzalo.garciadecastro@upf.edu](mailto:gonzalo.garciadecastro@upf.edu)!
