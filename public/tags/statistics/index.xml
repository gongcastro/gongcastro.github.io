      <description>When I started my PhD I had to get familiar with Linear Mixed Models very well very quickly. Then I was asked to present what I learnt and prepare this informal tutorial for my colleagues, which I presented on Match 10th, 2020. This is not supposed to be taken as a formal guide to linear mixed-effects models, but rather as a semi-coherent compilation of notes and self-suggestions that I considered worth sharing with my lab mates during my early stages of in the PhD.</description>
