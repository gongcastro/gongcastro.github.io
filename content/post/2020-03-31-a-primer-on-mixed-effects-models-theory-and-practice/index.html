<p>When I started my PhD I had to get familiar with <strong>Linear Mixed Models</strong> very well very quickly. Then I was asked to present what I learnt and prepare this informal tutorial for my colleagues, which I presented on March 10th, 2020 (yes, early pandemic :confounded:). This post shares the result.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not supposed to be taken as a formal guide to linear mixed-effects models, but rather as a semi-coherent compilation of notes and self-suggestions that I considered worth sharing with my lab mates during my early stages of in the PhD. Here are the <a href="https://gongcastro.github.io/2020-03-31_linear-mixed-models/#1">slides</a>:</p>

<p>What I should be taken more seriously are (1) the <strong>references</strong> I suggest in the first slides (which I consider some of the best resources available to learn linear mixed-effects models), and (2) the <strong>memes</strong>, which I personally curated and even created to sweeten up the dreadful incoherence of the content of some of the slides (sorry about that).</p>
<p>Before the presentation I tweeted one of the animations I generated for it.</p>

Tomorrow Iâ€™ll be talking about multilevel models with some colleagues. Iâ€™ve been playing with some <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dataviz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#dataviz</a> for the slides. Not perfect, but Iâ€™m quite happy with this.

<p>This tweet got some attention (for my usual numbers) and many kind folks have asked for the R code or the GIF file of the specific animation included in the tweet, so here they are (youâ€™ll also find them in the <a href="https://github.com/gongcastro/2020-03-31_linear-mixed-models">GitHub repository</a>) in a perhaps more comfortable format, ready to be cloned or downloaded):</p>
