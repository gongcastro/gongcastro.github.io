<p>I am a PhD student studying developmental psycholinguistics at the Center for Brain and Cognition (Universitat Pompeu Fabra), under the supervision of Prof. Núria Sebastian-Galles.</p>
<p>At the <strong>Speech Acquisition and Perception</strong> research group we investigate a wide range of topics related to cognition at different ages, with a special focus on language perception and acquisition. The focus of my research is the intersection between developmental psychology, language acquisition, bilingualism, and psycholinguistics. In short, I study how babies learn two languages simultaneously, and how this is reflected on the way they process and learn words.</p>
<p>I have a special interest on <strong>reproducibility</strong>. I like making my research available to others for several reasons: 1) I think it’s the right thing, 2) I think it’s one of the most efficient ways of improving the quality my work, and 3) because ensuring the computational reproducibility of my research is a challenge that makes me learn a lot about good research practices.</p>
<p>Sharing my work with others is one of the things I enjoy the most about research. Please, don’t hesitate to get in contact with me at <a href="mailto:gonzalo.garciadecastro@upf.edu">gonzalo.garciadecastro@upf.edu</a> if you have any interest in something I’m involved with. I will probably point you to someone more suitable and/or competent to address your question, but if that person turns out to be me (sorry about that, sometimes it happens) I’d be more than happy to address your concerns!</p>
