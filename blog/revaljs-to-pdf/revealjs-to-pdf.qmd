## TL;DR

Install [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) and adapt this command to download your slides---which should be deployed on GitHub Pages---as PDF in your local machine:

```bash
decktape <slides-url> <slides-file>.pdf
```

![](revealjs-to-pdf.png){width=50% fig-align=center}

So it turns out one can download their RevealJS slides (in a HTML file) without using decktape, just by following the instructions in the [Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf). In my defence, for whatever reason this did not work for me, whereas decktape did the job. I probably skipped a critical step.

I'm too lazy to re-orient or rewrite this post, so I'll publish it any way. Read it as if it were the panicky reflections of a sleepless PhD student who got overconfident about their programming skills the night before their conference presentation. decktape might be still a convenient option to do the same job in a programmatic way, so there it goes.

## Some context

Last week, I presented an oral communication at the [International Symposium of Psycholinguistics](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/isp2023). I feel comfortable using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), and I had already given a couple of presentations generating slides from Quarto before, so I decided to take the next step and use Quarto for this one as well.

I chose [RevealJS](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) as the output format of my slides: it looks beautiful, you don't need much knowledge of HTML or CSS to fix the layout of the slides, and it has a nice presenter view mode. In the end this is what my slides looked like:

```{r}
#| label: slides
library(xaringanExtra)
embed_xaringan(
  url = "https://gongcastro.github.io/isp_2023_trajectories/",
  ratio = "8:4.5"
)
```

I'm quite happy with how they look, so I even made a Quarto extension to apply this format to future presentations more conveniently.

The main inconvenience of RevealJS (or any HTML output format) is that presenting from a computer difference from the one in which you created the slides requires moving a whole folder, as opposed to just moving the `.pptx` or `.pdf` file to the new machine.

If one moves only the resulting `index.html` that contains the slides, the presentation will lose all of its nice formatting, and won't show any images or additional resources. From previous (bad) experiences, I knew that this could be a problem, and given that I would certainly have to present from the conference room's machine, I decided to use GitHub Pages^[[Here](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2021/11/18/deploying-xaringan-slides-a-ten-step-github-pages-workflow/) is a nice tutorials on how to deploy your slides on GitHub Pages] to [deploy my slides](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html) on a website.

My plan was to access the URL of the slides whenever I was about to present. But the day before the presentation, I started worrying about the internet not working and the conference venue at the wrong time I needed to export the slides to a PDF. A PDF never (well, rarely) fails.  

## The problem

Exporting Quarto slides to PDF is not as simple as just adding the `pdf: default` line to the YAML header of the file, under `format:`, like this:

```yaml
format:
  revealjs: default
  pdf: default
```

This will render the slides as a PDF *document*, not as *slides*. Also, much of the nice formatting would be lost, as the `.scss` file that contained the styling only applies to HTML.

Quarto offers a PDF output format for slides, [Beamer](https://ctan.org/pkg/beamer?lang=en), which is pretty popular among LaTeX users. But again, [generating the presentation in Beamer](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/beamer.html) format would require re-doing the formatting from scratch, and doing so in LaTeX, which I'm not totally comfortable using. This was not an option. Neither it was to use the [Power Point](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/powerpoint.html) output format, as not only the format was lost, but also prevented any possibility of customising the layout of the slides.

[![You may recognise this aesthetic from Beamer slides. I personally don't like it a lot, but I acknowledge the convenience of Beamer for LaTeX *conoisseurs*. I wish I was one of them. I'm not.](https://sharelatex-wiki-cdn-671420.c.cdn77.org/learn-scripts/images/1/1b/Beamer-titlepageUpdated.png){width=70% fig-align=center}](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Beamer)

## From RevealJS to PDF: printing option in Chrome

I came across the [Print to PDF](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) section of the [Presenting Slides](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/presenting.html#print-to-pdf) article in the Quarto documentation:

![A snapshot of the instructions to print a RevealJS presentation to PDF in the Quarto documentation (see Chrome's printing menu on the right, prompted byu `Ctrl + P`.](print-to-pdf.png)

Although this looked promising, the output of this method was not what I expected. The layout had been moved around a bit, and some formatting options were not preserved. I this presentation was aimed at my colleagues, it would have been ok-ish, but it was not for a conference presentation.

At this point I was already considering staying up all night re-doing the presentation in Power Point, and forgetting about Quarto for a while. In the last minute, when reading the [RevealJS documentation](https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/#alternative-ways-to-export), I found the suggestion of using **decktape**:

![My salvation](revealjs-docs.png)

I was not very hopeful about this. [decktape](https://github.com/astefanutti/decktape) is written in JavaScript, which I'm not very familiar with, and I feared wasting too much time trying to make it work instead of just doing everything from scratch in Power Point. **But it worked!**. These are the steps I followed, according to the dektape docs.

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)
2. Install [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) from the Node.js console:

```js
npm install -g npm
```

Then following the instructions in the decktape repository:

3. Install decktape from the Node.js console:

```js
npm install -g decktape
```

4. Finally, using the `decktape` command to download my slides deployed on Github Pages as a PDF:

```js
decktape https://gongcastro.github.io/ips_2023_trajectories slides.pdf
```

And it did the job, preserving the layout, SCSS formatting, and even the links!
